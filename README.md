# Stores Sales Prediction | iNeuron | Internship Project

## Problem Statement :

Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.

Building a solution and deployment of the model that should able to predict the sales of the different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.

## Dataset :

The dataset is taken from a Kaggle. You can download the dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/brijbhushannanda1979/bigmart-sales-data](https://www.kaggle.com/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction)

## Approach :

Applying the machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing to build a solution that should able to predict the premium of the person's health insurance.

- **Data Exploration :** Exploring the dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis :** Plotted different graphs to get more insights about dependent and independent variables/features.
- **Feature Engineering :** Numerical features scaled down and Categorical features encoded.
- **Model Building :** In this step, first dataset Splitting is done. After that model is trained on different Machine Learning Algorithms such as:
  1) Linear Regression
  2) Random Forest Regression
- **Model Selection :** Tested all the models to check the RMSE & R-squared.
- **Pickle File** : Selected model as per best RMSE score & R-squared and created pickle file using pickle library.
- **Webpage & Deployment :** Created a web application that takes all the necessary inputs from the user & shows the output. Then deployed project on the Heroku Platform.
